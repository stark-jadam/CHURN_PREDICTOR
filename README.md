# CHURN_PREDICTOR
This Streamlit.io application was built for a retail/e-commerce small business by Adam Stark.  A sample dataset from Kaggle has been substituted to not violate any privacy laws or company policies.  

The initial data in 'online_retail_customer_churn.csv' was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hassaneskikri/online-retail-customer-churn-dataset

The churn prediction is based on a Random Forest model trained on the Kaggle dataset.  

A visualization dashboard was also built by Adam Stark and may be found here:  https://churnpredictor-buvdrlcqjohxzemtcx6qkk.streamlit.app/
