# CHURN_PREDICTOR
This Streamlit.io application was built as part of his WGU Capstone project by Adam Stark.  

The initial data in 'online_retail_customer_churn.csv' was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hassaneskikri/online-retail-customer-churn-dataset

The churn prediction is based on a Random Forest model trained on the Kaggle dataset.
